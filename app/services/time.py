"""Timezone-aware helpers.

Companies operate in their own timezone (default Asia/Riyadh). The cron tick
runs in server time, but date-sensitive logic (recurring journals, reminders)
should evaluate "today" in the company's timezone so a 9 PM Riyadh tick on the
last day of the month doesn't accidentally roll into the next month.
